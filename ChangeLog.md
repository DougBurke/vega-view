# Changelog for vega-view

## 0.3.0.4

Fixed directory browsing: previously things didn't work out so well if
there were no Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations in the working directory,
but now you can properly recurse into sub-directories.

## 0.3.0.3

Oops: chaning from a bytestring to a text during development caused
"problems". There really should be a swooshy icon on the home page now,
and the a text rendering of the SVG...

## 0.3.0.2

Add a link back to the "home page" in the page header.

The home page has a swooshy icon on it, to try and visually indicate
that you can drag onto the page.

## 0.3.0.1

Tweak the styling on some of the pages to use the "new look"â„¢.

## 0.3.0.0

Add drag-and-drop support to the main page. You can now drag in a file
(or multiple files) and have their contents be displayed. There is a mode
for selecting how new visualizations are added to the page: at the top
(default), at the bottom, or clear-out any previous plots.

## 0.2.0.2

Bump base minimum version to supporg ghc 8 or later, to save
hackage trying to build with older versions. There is no user-visible
change to version 0.2.

## 0.2.0.1

Internal change to get it to build with ghc 8.2 and 8.0.

## 0.2

The directory view now displays all the visualizations in a directory,
and hides those files that are not JSON. Selecting a visualization can
now open it in a new page (0.1 behavior) or inline (new).

## 0.1

Initial release
