# Changelog for vega-view

## 0.3.0.0

Add drag-and-drop support to the main page. You can now drag in a file
(or multiple files) and have their contents be displayed. There is a mode
for selecting how new visualizations are added to the page: at the top
(default), at the bottom, or clear-out any previous plots.

## 0.2.0.2

Bump base minimum version to supporg ghc 8 or later, to save
hackage trying to build with older versions. There is no user-visible
change to version 0.2.

## 0.2.0.1

Internal change to get it to build with ghc 8.2 and 8.0.

## 0.2

The directory view now displays all the visualizations in a directory,
and hides those files that are not JSON. Selecting a visualization can
now open it in a new page (0.1 behavior) or inline (new).

## 0.1

Initial release
